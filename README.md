## How I Can Help Your Team 📈
- Modernize and streamline through *automation and AI/ML* applied with wisdom and ethics.
- Stand up or *stabilize backends & data flows* that command regulated/mission-critical processes.
- Bring order to *inventory, contracts, and operational data* so decisions aren’t stonewalled by spreadsheets.
- Translate ambiguous requirements into *clear acceptance criteria* and iterate quickly.
- Battle-harden product and code before deployment via *kitchen-sink testing processes*.
- Manifest *integrated data visualizations* from tangled and complex operational trees.

Please do reach out.
